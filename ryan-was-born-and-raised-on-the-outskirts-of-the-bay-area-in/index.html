<p>Ryan was born and raised on the outskirts of the Bay Area in Northern California. Growing up in this rustic small-town setting, photography was the furthest thing from Ryan’s mind. He spent his youth riding dirt bikes, working on cars with his dad, and throwing the occasional dirt clod at a variety of targets or quarry, depending on your point of view. Ryan was always a creative child with what could even be described of as an overactive imagination. As a teenager he found something to focus his overflowing artistic propensity toward - Rock ’n’ roll. He picked up the bass guitar and completely immersed himself into music.</p><p>After high school Ryan moved to Hollywood with his rock band Depswa. He would play in Depswa for nearly a decade while getting signed to Geffen Records. Three years later, after an innumerable amount of shows and touring all over North America, Ryan came back to Los Angeles. It was during this time, by what could be described as either happenstance or a pure twist of fate, Ryan found himself working in photography. He started in high fashion and commercial photography, and bounced around from being a Producer to a Photo Assistant and a Digital Tech.</p><p>It was only a matter of time before Ryan got the itch and wanted to shoot. He started out shooting friends’ bands. And with only a handful of shoots under his belt, Ryan developed the credence that not only could he truly shoot, but that photography was in fact what he wanted to devote himself to fully.</p><p>It’s no surprise that Ryan naturally gravitated toward shooting music artists, but no one could predict he would crave out such a thriving niche this early in his career. He has shot a plethora of diverse artists such as up and coming Hip-Hop star Sam Adams, Panamanian rockers Cage9, and nü metal pioneers Limp Bizkit.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="21"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="23"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="24"><span data-reactid="25"><!-- react-empty: 26 --><h2 data-reactid="27"><a data-reactid="28">Ryan Burchfield Photography</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="30"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="31"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="32"></div></section></div></div>
